= Introduction =

Our TraceBookTrack files contain osm data and media data which is linked to files relative to the folder the `*`.tbt files are stored in.


= Details =

Each `*`.tbt file has a standard xml header. The default encoding of the file is UTF-8.
example: {{{<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' standalone='yes' ?>}}}
It is followed by the root node with the name "osm" which contains information about the osm version that it conforms to, and which generator tool created it. This makes the file readable for JOSM even without our plugin, if you rename it to "`*`.osm", with the limitation that no media information can be displayed.
example: {{{<osm version="0.6" generator="TraceBook">}}}

The root node may contain either nodes or ways.
example{{{<node lat="52.4569883" lon="13.2957700" id="2" timestamp="2011-03-07T14:40:51.105+0000" version="1" />}}}
or {{{<way version="1" id="1">}}}
A node contains coordinates, a unique id and an editing version.
A way contains only the unique id and the editing version.
