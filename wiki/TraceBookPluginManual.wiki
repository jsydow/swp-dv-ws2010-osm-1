#summary This page describes the installation and usage of the TraceBook import plugin for JOSM.

= Introduction =

The TraceBookImport plugin for JOSM enables JOSM to read TraceBookTrack (*.tbt) files which are created by our TraceBook application for android mobile devices.


= Known Bugs and Limitations =

The Plugin can not:
 * save a modified track
 * manipulate media information
 * delete track information/whole tracks
use the TraceBook app on your device for that stuff or delete folders manually.
