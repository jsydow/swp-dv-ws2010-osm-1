= Summary =

= Detail = 

== Node ==

In general every node we get from the gps has:
  * latitude
  * longitude
  * timestamp

These are the data every node has at a minimum.
There are also the data a Node in osm xml format has.
Additionally osm-nodes have tags.

The dataformat for all these metadata according to osm-specificaion is:
  * latitude: Interval [-90, 90], 7 digits precision => float
  * longitude: Interval [-180, 180], 7 digits precision => float
  * timestamp: http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime
  * tags: key (k) and value (v) are Strings: `<tag k="str" v="str" />`

== Way ==

Ways are a list of Nodes + Timestamp + Tags according to osm format.

== Areas ==

Areas are in osm simply Ways with a landuse-tag and possibly a area=yes-tag
