= Introduction =

Here you will see a base overview of the main parts involved in TraceBook.


= Details =

TraceBook is an Android based Java application which has only one external dependency, which is the [http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/ mapsforge] library which we use to draw a map layer. We use only standard Java and Android methods.   

= Core =
The core of TraceBook consists of a main "WayLoggerService"  which is a service of TraceBook and is running continuously in background and a "DataStorage" engine which handles serialization, deserialization and handling of the collected date in main memory. The "WayLoggerService" is accessible from all parts of the code and is detached form the gui. It provides all core functionality to start and track routes.
