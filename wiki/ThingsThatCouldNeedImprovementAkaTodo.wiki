#summary Some things that could be done

= Introduction =

Brain dump of what could be done in week 4 aside from the new product backlog.

= Improvements =

== Functional things (features) ==

  * search in tracklist `[`partly done`]`
  * sort by timestamp/name `[`done`]`
  * before renaming track check if there is such a track already `[`done`]`
  * improve waypoint filtering
  * Landscape should not crash/behave strangely `[`does not crash anymore`]`
  * show images of tags
  * unhardcode visible strings `[`hopefully done`]`
  * tag history: user can choose between most used and most recently used.

== Non-functional ==

  * Logging (one central class, different methods of logging) `[`partly done`]`
  * stability (no leaks, occasional errors, checking for nullpointers etc)
  * optimisation (speed-wise e.g.) (newTrackActivity starts slowly)
  * general usability / gui tweaks
  * Javadoc

= Missing =

  * Documentation external/internal
  * Preferences
