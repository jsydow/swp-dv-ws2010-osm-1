= Introduction =

Core.data contains the data model of the tracking application. All tracked data are stored here an can be retrieved, changed, saved to SD-card and loaded from SD-card.

= Details =

First of all read the wiki article [Data Data].

The data model is a like a tree:
  * !DataStorage contains:
   * !DataTrack contains:
    * !DataNode (POIs) contains:
     * tags
     * !DataMedia
    * !DataPointsList (ways and areas) contains:
     * !DataMedia
     * !DataNode contains:
      * tags
      * !DataMedia
     * tags
    * !DataMedia

== !DataStorage ==

!DataStorage is the class that has all other data in it. It is therefore like a root-object. The whole data model is like a tree. Since all other parts of the application should only work on one "database" of the tracking data this class is modeled as Singleton. There is at most one instance of !DataStorage.

The data in a !DataStorage object are tracks. Tracks are like tracking sessions. They contain all data that were recorded and edited in one (or multiple) application usage sessions.

Folling operations are implemented:
  
  * load tracks
  * get loaded tracks
  * delete tracks
  * create new tracks
  * get a list of all tracks on the SD-card

There is a special reference to a loaded track called currentWay. The current way is the way that is currently edited. There is at most one current way.
