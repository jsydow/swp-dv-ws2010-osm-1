  * To allow getting GPS data only when needed, it would be good to have the GPS service as a bound service, to allow it to deliver its data via RPC.
  A bound service typically lives only while it serves another application component and does *not run in the background indefinitely*. _check if it stays there if there is no request for some time._
  * The core should bind this service while tracking, so it will not be suspended if the UI gets suspended.

Maybe the roles can be swapped. *In any case* the UI has to start something that runs indefinitely *for sure*!
