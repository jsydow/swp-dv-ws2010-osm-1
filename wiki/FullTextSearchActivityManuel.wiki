In this dialog you can perform a full text search based on the wiki description article related to tag value pairs.


= Details =
Here you have a pretty nice way to find the right tag value pair which suites to your point of interest.

Just type something where you think it will suit to a valid tag value pair.

In our example we have typed "highway".As you can see you will get all results which contains the word highway in the description text and in the tag value pair.
